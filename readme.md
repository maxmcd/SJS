#SJS

SJS is a theme for the portfolio site [stephaniejonesstudio.com](http://stephaniejonesstudio.com). 

The theme uses the tumblr api to populate and filter content based on tag values. 

This is an experimental theme that attempts to create more visually complex site layouts, while maintaining the Tumblr CMS's simplicity and familiarity.
